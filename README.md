# Project: Game AI
## Project Description:
The project is a Python based project that utilizes the OpenAI gym and gym-retro
environments to train an agent to play retro video games. The possible algorithms
for training are a vanilla Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm, a Double DQN (DDQN) algorithm,
and a Dueling DDQN algorithm.

The following videos represent an agent that was trained for 1000 iterations
using the Dueling DDQN algorithm:
